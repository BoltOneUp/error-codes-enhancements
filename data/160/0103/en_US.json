			"long_description": "There was a problem with your systems memory. This is most often caused by failing NAND chips, but may also be due to corrupted title installations, or even unknown random MLC errors.",
			"short_solution": "See support page",
			"long_solution": "Use https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/WiiUIdent immediately to identify which manufacturer produced your NAND chip. If you have a Hynix chip, your chip is likely failing. Your only solution is to try and backup your NAND entirely and move it to another device/chip.\n\nIf you do not have a Hynix chip, a title you tried to launch is likely corrupted. Try reinstalling the title.",
